                In this project, we argue that the optimal noise schedule should \
                adapt to each inference instance, and introduce the Time \
                Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) to accomplish this. \
                TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module \
                (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current \
                latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM \
                using reinforcement learning, aiming to maximize a reward \
                that discounts the final image quality by the number of denoising steps. With such an adaptive scheduler, TPDM not \
                only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely \
                with human preferences but also adjusts the number of denoising steps and time on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency.",
